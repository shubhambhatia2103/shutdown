# Python Script to Shutdown Computer
As we know, Python is a popular scripting language because of its versatile features. In this article, we will write a Python script to shutdown a computer.
To shut down the computer/PC/laptop by using a Python script, you have to use the `os.system()` function with the code
```bash
shutdown /s /t 1
```

```bash
For this to work, you have to import os library in the ide. If you don’t have it, then ‘pip install os‘ through the Command Prompt.
Causion: Please ensure that you save and close all the program before running this code on the IDLE, as the below program will immediately shut down your computer.
